# MoviesCatalogChallenge
A challenge project where the app had to consume 2 different APIs to compose a movie list while respecting to API limitations.

In order to run this project you need to create an **API KEY** from the **moviedb** Api. you can learn more about it here: https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction

After getting the key, in the build.gradle file, change **YOUR_API_KEY** to the key you created.
